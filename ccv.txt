azimuth rotational angle

crossing over the y = 0 line will fip the camera's azimuth

try assign velocity vector to the view.cam.lookat -> see if without computing azimuth? and elevation?, it gets rendering that works

Make camera azimuth proper when it crosses y=0 line multiple times


when camera setting is set to "camera.tracking," azimuth is with respect to the camera instead of where the camera is looking at!!!

viewer.cam.distance = distance of the camera from where the camera is looking at (it's like a radius) and changing the azimuth will rotate the camera position around where it's looking at with this distance. Like a circle
